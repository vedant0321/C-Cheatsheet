# **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

Memory allocation done at the time of execution(run time) is known as dynamic memory allocation. Functions calloc() and malloc() support allocating dynamic memory. The Dynamic allocation space is allocated using these functions when the value is returned by functions and assigned to pointer variables. 

#### **malloc() function in c++**
```
The malloc() function which is defined under <cstdlib> header file is used to allocate block of memory and returns a void pointer to the allocated memory block’s first byte if the allocation succeeds.
```


**Syntax:**

```cpp
data_type* malloc(size_t sizeof(data_type));
```

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n = 5;
    int *ptr = (int * ) malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ptr[i] = i * 2;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        /* ptr[i] and *(ptr+i) can be used interchangeably */
        cout << ptr[i] << endl;
    }
    
    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}


Output:
0
2
4
6
8
```


#### **calloc() function in c++**

The calloc() function works same as that of malloc with the only difference being that it sets all the bits of the allocated memory to zero and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block’s first byte if the allocation succeeds.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
data_type* calloc(size_t num, sizeof(data_type));
```

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int *ptr = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        /* ptr[i] and *(ptr+i) can be used interchangeably */
        cout << ptr[i] << endl;
    }
    
    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}


Output:

0
0
0
0
0
```

 Runtime error can happen if the variable that is used to allocate the memory block, contains a garbage value or some type of undefined value. Generally, we have two types of memory in our systems:

- **Stack memory:** It has a fixed value of size for which an array could be declared in the contiguous form.   
     
- **Heap memory:** It is the memory where the array declared is not stored in a contiguous way. If we want to declare an array of size 100000, we do not have the contiguous space in the memory of the same size. We will be declaring the array using heap memory as it necessarily doesn’t require a contiguous allocation; it will allocate the space wherever it gets and links all the memory blocks together.

**Note:** Global variables are stored using heap memory.

The memory declaration using heap memory is known as **dynamic memory allocation,** while the one using stack is known as **compile-time memory allocation**. 

**Syntax:**

```cpp
int *arr = new int[size_of_array];
```

For simply allocating variables dynamically, use this:

```cpp
int *var = new int;
```

Here, we are using a **new** keyword**,** which is used to declare the dynamic memory in C++. There are other ways too, but this one is the most efficient.

**Note:** Stack memory releases itself as the scope of the variable gets over, but in the case of heap memory, it needs to be released manually at last otherwise, the memory gets accumulated and, in the end, leads to memory leakage. For this purpose we use delete keyword.

**The syntax for releasing an array:**

```cpp
delete [ ] arr;
```

**The syntax for releasing the memory of the variable:**

```cpp
delete var;
```
