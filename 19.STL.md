## **Introduction**

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks. It provides four components called algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators.
### **Containers in C++**

The Containers Library in STL  is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects, which in simplest words can be described as the objects used to contain data or rather a collection of objects, and it allows great flexibility in the types supported as elements. The container manages the storage space for its elements and provides member functions to access them, either directly or through iterators. Some container classes are vector, list, forward_list, queue, priority_queue, stack, set, multiset, map, multimap, unordered_set.

**Vector-** A vector is a sequence container class that implements a dynamic array, which means that the size of the array automatically changes when appending elements. A vector stores the elements in contiguous memory locations and allocates the memory as needed at run time.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
vector < object_type > v1;
```

Certain functions associated with the vector are:

1. **begin() –** Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector
2. **end() –** Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector
3. **rbegin() –** Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element
4. **rend() –** Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the vector (considered as the reverse end)
5. **cbegin() –** Returns a constant iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.
6. **cend() –** Returns a constant iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the vector’s last element.
7. **crbegin() –** Returns a constant reverse iterator, pointing to the vector’s last element (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element
8. **crend() –** Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the vector (considered as the reverse end)
9. **push_back() -** It adds a new element at the end.
10. **pop_back() -** It removes the last element from the vector.
11. **clear() -** It removes all the elements of the vector.


**Example:** 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector < int > v;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
        v.push_back(i);
    cout << "Output of begin and end: ";
    for (auto i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ++i)
        cout << * i << " ";
    v.pop_back();
    cout << "\nOutput after pop: ";
    for (auto i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ++i)
        cout << * i << " ";
    cout << "\nOutput of rbegin and rend: ";
    for (auto ir = v.rbegin(); ir != v.rend(); ++ir)
        cout << * ir << " ";
    cout << "\nOutput of crbegin and crend : ";
    for (auto ir = v.crbegin(); ir != v.crend(); ++ir)
        cout << * ir << " ";
    return 0;
 }
```

```cpp
Output:
Output of begin and end: 1 2 3 4 5 
Output after pop: 1 2 3 4 
Output of rbegin and rend: 4 3 2 1 
Output of crbegin and crend : 4 3 2 1 
```
