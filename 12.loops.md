## **Introduction**

Loops in C++ come into use when we need to execute a block of statements repeatedly.

There are mainly two types of loops:

    **1. Entry Controlled Loops**: In an entry controlled loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. **For Loop** and **While Loop** are entry controlled loops.

    **2. Exit Controlled Loop**: In the exit controlled loop, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. The **do-while loop** is an exit controlled loop.
**i) For loop:** A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to write a loop that is executed a specific number of times. The loop enables us to perform ‘n’ number of steps together in one line.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
for (initialization expression; condition expression; update expression) {
    // body of-loop 
}
```

Here,

- **initialization -** Initialization is executed first done only once, where the loop variables are initialized to some value.
- **condition -** This expression involves testing the condition, if the condition evaluates to true then the body of the loop is executed however, if the condition evaluates to false then we exit from the loop, and the control jumps to the statements following the loop.
- **update - After the execution of the body of the loop, the control jumps to the update expression where the loop variables are updated by some value.**

**After updating the values of the loop variables, again the condition is evaluated and if it's true then the body of the loop is executed and the process continues until the condition expression evaluated to false and we exit from the loop.**

**Example: Print Hello World 5 times using for loop.**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        cout << "Hello World\n";
    }
    return 0;
}

Output:
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
```


**Example: Iterate array elements using the auto keyword.**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int arr[] {40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100};
    for (auto element: arr)
        cout << element << " ";
    return 0;
}

Output:
40 50 60 70 80 90 100 
```

**ii) While loop:** In a while loop, the condition is evaluated first, and if it returns true, then the statements inside the while loop execute. This repeatedly happens until the condition returns false. When the condition returns false, the control comes out of the loop and jumps to the program’s next statement after the while loop.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
initialization;
while (condition) {
    // statements
    update_expression;
}
```

**Note:** The important point to note when using while loop is that we need to use increment or decrement statement inside while loop so that the loop variable gets changed on each iteration, and at some point, the condition returns false. This way, we can end the execution of the while loop. Otherwise, the loop would execute indefinitely.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int i = 1;
    // The loop would continue to print the value of i till 
    //the condition is false.
    while (i <= 5) {
        cout << "Value of i is: " << i << endl;
        i++;
    }
}

Output:
Value of i is: 1
Value of i is: 2
Value of i is: 3
Value of i is: 4
Value of i is: 5
```

**iii)do-while loop:** The do...while loop is similar to a while loop with one difference, i.e. the condition is tested at the end of the loop-body thus the loop-body is executed at least once irrespective of the condition which makes it an exit-controlled loop.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
initialization;
do {
    // statements
    update_expression;
}
while (condition);
```

Here,

- First, the body of the loop is executed, then the condition is evaluated
- If the **condition** evaluates to **true**, the loop’s body inside the do statement is executed again.
- The **condition** is evaluated once again and the process continues until the condition evaluated to false.


**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Initialization expression
    int i = 2;
    do
    {
        // Statement of body of loop
        cout << "Inside body of do-while loop" << endl;
        // Update expression
        i++;
    } while (i < 1); // Update expression
}

Output:
Inside body of do-while loop
```

**iv)for_each loop:** Apart from the standard loops such as “for, while and do-while,” C++  also allows using another functionality that solves the same purpose termed **“for_each”** loops. This loop accepts a function that executes over each of the container elements. 

This loop is defined in the header file “algorithm” and hence has to be included for this loop’s successful operation.

Advantages of for_each loop:

- It is versatile, i.e., it can work with any container.
- It reduces chances of errors one can commit using generic for loop
- It makes code more readable
- for_each loops improve the overall performance of code

**Syntax:**

```cpp
for_each (InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Function fn)
```

Here,

- **first −** Input iterator to the initial position.
- **last −** Final iterator to the final position.
- **fn −** Unary function that accepts an element in the range as an argument.



**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int print_even(int n) {
    if (n % 2 == 0)
        cout << n << ' ';
}
int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};     
    cout << "The Array contains the following even numbers" << endl;
    for_each(arr, arr + 5, print_even);
    return 0;
}
Output:
The array contains the following even numbers
2 4
```

for_each loop can be executed using the keyword “for.”

**Example:** 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    // Printing elements of an array using foreach loop 
    for (int x: arr)
        cout << x << ' ';
    return 0;
}
Output:
1 2 3 4 
```
