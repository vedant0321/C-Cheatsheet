Address Typecasting

\
## **Address Typecasting**

While declaring a pointer, why can’t we just write like this:

```cpp
int a = 5;
pointer p = &a;
```

Why do we have a complicated syntax like:

```cpp
int a = 5;
int *p = &a;
```

It’s generally because we need to specify that when we invoke a particular pointer, how will the compiler know what type of value a pointer has stored, and while invoking/transferring data, how much space needs to be allotted to it.

That is why while declaring a pointer, we start with the data type and then assign the name to the pointer. That data type specifies what type of value we are storing in the pointer.



The term **typecasting** means assigning one type of data to another type, like storing an integer value to a char data type. 

**Example:**

```cpp
int x= 65;
char c = x;
```

When you check the value stored in variable ‘c ‘, it will print the ASCII value stored at that integer variable, i.e., ‘x’, and print ‘A’ (whose ASCII value is 65).

This type of typecasting done above is known as **implicit typecasting** as the compiler itself interprets the conversion of integer value to ASCII character value.

**Example:**

```cpp
int i = 65; 
int *p = &i;
char *pc = (char*) p;
```

You can see that in the third line, we can’t directly do like this:

```cpp
char *pc = p;
```

This will give an error as we are trying to store an integer-type pointer value into a character-type value. To remove the error, we have to type-cast ourselves by providing (char*) on the right-hand side as done in the code above. This type of typecasting is known as **explicit typecasting**.

## **Reference and Pass by Reference**

Usually  (&) symbol is known as a reference operator, which means ‘Address of operator.’

This operator is used to copy the values of any variable and guarantee that the reflected changes will also be visible in the copied variable.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = a;
    a++;
    cout << "b = " << b << endl;
    return 0;
}
Output:
b = 5
```

Here, it means that only the value is copied, and when the value of the variable is increased by one, then the changes are not reflected in variable ‘b.’

**Example:**

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int & b = a;
    a++;
    cout << "b = " << b << endl;
    return 0;
}
Output:
b = 6
```

Here, (&b=a) means that now variables b and a are pointing to the same address and making changes in any of them reflected in both of the variables.

This concept of referencing the variables is useful when we want to update the value passed to the function. When we normally pass a value to a variable, then a copy of those is created in the system, and the original values remain unchanged. But by passing the reference, the changes are also reflected in the original variables as there is no extra copy created. The first type of argument passing is known as **pass by value,** and the later one is known as **pass by reference.**


**The syntax for pass by reference:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void fun(int & a) {
    a++;
}
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    fun(a);
    cout << "a = " << a << endl;
}
Output:
a = 6
```

#### **Advantages of Pass by reference:**

- Reduction in-memory storage.
- Changes can be reflected easily.
