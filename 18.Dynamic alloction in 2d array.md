## **Dynamic Memory Allocation of Two-Dimensional(2D) Arrays**

To create a 2D array in the heap memory, we use the following syntax:

Suppose we want to create a 2D array of size n x m, with the name of the array as ‘arr’:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int ** arr = new int * [n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = new int[m];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

You can see that first-of-all, we have declared a pointer of pointers of size n, and then at each pointer, while traversing, we allocated the array of size m using a new keyword.




Similarly, we can release this memory using the following syntax:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int ** arr = new int * [n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        delete[] arr[i];
    }
    delete[] arr;
}
```

First-of-all, we cleared the memory allocated to each of the n pointers and then finally deleted those n pointers.

This way, using the delete keyword, we can release the memory of the 2D arrays.


## **Static Memory Allocation**

When the amount of memory to be allocated is known beforehand, i.e., it is known as Static Memory Allocation at the time of compilation. Once the memory is allocated statically, it cannot be deallocated during the program run. So it leads to wastage of storage space. We generally pass constants while declaring arrays.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
int A[100];
```

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a[100];
    const int size = 5;
    int b[size];
    return 0;
}
```



## **Macros and the Global Variable**

Suppose in a code the value pi(3.14) is used many times, instead of always writing 3.14 everywhere in the code, what we can do is define this value to some variable, say pi at the beginning of the program, and now every time we need the value 3.14, we just need to write pi.

What we can do is that we can create a global variable with the value 3.14 and then use it anywhere as desired. There is one issue in using global variables, and that is if someone changes the value of pi in our code at any point of time in any of the functions, we could lose that original value.

To avoid such a situation, what we do is use macros. 



The syntax **for using it:**

```cpp
#define pi 3.14
```

This is done after declaring the header files at the beginning itself so that this value can be used in the later encountered functions. Here, what we are doing is that we are declaring the value of the pi as 3.14 using the macros (#) define, which locks the value and makes it unchangeable.

Another advantage is that it prevents extra storage in the memory for declaring a new variable. Using macros, we have specified that the value we are using is a part of the compiler code, hence no need to create any extra memory.

Now, discussing the advantages of the global variable:

- When we want to use the same variable with modified values in each of them, then we can use global variables as the changes done in one function are visible in all the others.
- It saves time for passing the values by reference in the functions.

Due to accidental changes, this method is not preferred much.


## **Constant Variables**

We are now moving on to the constant variables identified by the const keyword in C++. As the name suggests, if we declare any keyword as constant, we can’t change its value throughout the program.

Note: The constant variable needs to be assigned during initialization only; else, it will store garbage values that can’t be changed further.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
const datatype variable_name = value;
```

**Example:**

```cpp
const int a = 5;
```
